## Step 2 - Find the control you want to change

You can change the caption of every field, tab or action.

Fields and Tabs can be found in "Layout" and "Actions" can be found in (eh...) actions.

Intellisense will help you find the control very easily.

## TIP: Use F12 on the page you extend to see the controls
